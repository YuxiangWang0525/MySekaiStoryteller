MySekaiStoryteller lets you build fan stories using Live2D models, backgrounds, voices, transitions, and visual effects — then preview them in real time. Available on desktop and Android.

> This project is in beta. Back up your project data before upgrading.

## Features

- Compose stories from snippets: dialogue, scene changes, motions, effects, and more
- Live2D support — works with models from multiple games, not just Project SEKAI
- Parallel snippets for running animations simultaneously
- Drag-and-drop snippet ordering
- Lip-sync support
- Real-time preview in the editor; full playback via a dedicated player window

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 22, pnpm 10, Rust, and the [Tauri v2 system dependencies](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your platform.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

Common checks:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm build
cd src-tauri && cargo check
```

Build native installers:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

### Android

Requires Android SDK/NDK, JDK, and the Rust Android targets.

```bash
# First-time setup (skip if gen/android already exists)
pnpm android:init

# Run on a device or emulator
pnpm android:dev

# Production APK/AAB
pnpm tauri android build --apk --target aarch64
```

Notes:

- The first build downloads Gradle and Android dependencies from the official Google Maven and Maven Central repositories. On restricted networks, set `MSS_USE_ALIYUN_MAVEN=true` to opt into the Aliyun Maven mirrors.
- Navigation is handled in-app via `#/editor/:project` and `#/player/:project` — no multi-window.
- The player uses automatic timeline playback, no tap-to-advance.
- To preview the mobile shell in a desktop browser: `localStorage.setItem('mss.mobileShell','1')` or append `?mobileShell=1`.
